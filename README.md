# Ducky Dares To Archive
#### Last Updated: 2022.02.2022

This is a public repository documenting the various endeavors I pursue. It started as a fork from [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and will continue to grow into its own shape.

Contains basic configuration to get you a site with:

- Sample posts.
- Sample top navigation.
- Sample author sidebar with social links.
- Sample footer links.
- Paginated home page.
- Archive pages for posts grouped by year, category, and tag.
- Sample about page.
- Sample 404 page.
- Site wide search.

Replace sample content with your own and [configure as necessary](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).

## TODO
- [ ] Replace sample content with my own over time
- [ ] Add structures for different project posts
- [ ] Determine how to pages list in

## Troubleshooting

If you have a question about using Jekyll, start a discussion on the [Jekyll Forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll). Other resources:

- [Configuring GitHub Metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration) to work properly when developing locally and avoid `No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.` warnings.
