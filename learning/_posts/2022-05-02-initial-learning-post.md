I've been working more avidly on the mood playlist generator and am now looking to add in little learning modules for different sub-sections that I'm learning as a noob or becoming more proficient in. This post as you can probably tell has to do with **project management**.

> I'm still relatively new to the concept of project management so this is a learning process for all of us!

In this post, I'm specifically going to talk about the project management software: [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) although I know that there are other out there like Notion (highly recommend), Asana, and Proofhub. My decision to focus onJira is due to the it's focus on projects that are software related although it can be extended to other types of projects. I still to use Notion for those projects though.

As this is the initial post bear with me with the format of presentation of information and whatever else comes along with it. It'll grow to get better over time.

Talking points:
- What can Jira do for you?
Jira offers project management styles that adhere to software lifecycles and agile development centered around scrums. This helps teach the utility of Kanban boards, Gant charts, and scrum processes (although more limited if solo project). In addition to being great visual tools for a seeing the current state of a project, these tools teach you more about your own current time management, areas you like spending time on and areas you struggle on, and how to utilize these tools to help lead teams/communities through the software lifecycle.
