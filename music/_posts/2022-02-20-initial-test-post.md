This is my first post to the archives, aka the abyss.

I wanted to start off sharing something simple that I already do for myself. Sharing playlists I make! I made this playlist around Thursday of this week and will try and continue keeping a rythm of once a week. A lot goes through these ears so I might as well take some more time to filter out my own interpretations.

**Watch Me**

I had to luxury of learning a bit more about web development in order to embed functionality from external platforms into my posts. For some reason, I also decided it would be cool if I could make updates to this website from my phone....so behold! I set up a small development environment that will let me accomplish that  (Maybe I'll share it~). Sadly, local validation is not possible unless I figure out a way for jekyll to run on android... _naah_

Anyways, I think it'll be nice to hear what absolute chaos sounds like so that you have a better reference for how not to pack your shit up.

Till next week enjoy watching me ramp up on these lil gems.
