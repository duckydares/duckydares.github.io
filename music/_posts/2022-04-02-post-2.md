I have been swimming...well barely...more like I've been floating through the ether without givin' a single fuck. Shit was hectic grinding at work too but that's hardly an excuse so, you feel me, just going to continue with this and acknowledge that I'm behind for by a whole month...GOOD NEWS is that I did still make playlists for two out of those four weeks. So not a complete failure...2/8 LOL.

## Geeker
The first playlist is a tribute to my internal geeker and the Ruler. GIP. You know we all trying to just be higher beings.

## Der Teufel ist der Gangsta
The twist here is a different language. Feel free to listen to it even if you can't understand the lyrics the vibe will still be understood. Plus shit maybe the got a lyric translator for the hella curious.

With this post I had the honor of learning how to adjust the sizes of the embedded playlists
